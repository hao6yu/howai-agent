# UX Backlog

## Deferred Item 1 (next iteration)
- Simplify the chat input bar and action density to reduce first-time cognitive load.
- Scope to revisit:
  - Prioritize core actions (type/send/speak) and progressively reveal secondary tools.
  - Improve button grouping and visual hierarchy in compact widths.
  - Re-check thumb reach and accidental tap risk for the right-side controls.
  - Validate with first-session flow (new user to first successful message/call).
