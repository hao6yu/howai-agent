Next Phase Solution Design & Project Plan

1. Smart Reminders & Scheduling
Goal:
Let users create, view, and manage reminders/events via chat, integrating with iOS Calendar and Reminders.
Key Tasks:
Research and select a Flutter plugin for iOS Calendar/Reminders (e.g., device_calendar, flutter_local_notifications, or custom platform channels for advanced needs).
Design conversational UI for event/reminder creation (e.g., “Remind me to call mom at 7pm”).
Implement permission handling for calendar/reminder access.
Parse user intent (NLP) for date/time/event extraction.
Add event/reminder to iOS system and confirm with user.
List, edit, and delete reminders/events via chat.
Considerations:
iOS privacy policies and permission prompts.
Fallback to in-app reminders if system access denied.

2. Daily Briefing
Goal:
Provide a morning summary: weather, news, calendar events, and personalized tips.
Key Tasks:
Integrate weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
Integrate news API (e.g., NewsAPI, Google News).
Fetch today’s calendar events (reuse calendar integration).
Generate personalized tips (e.g., “Don’t forget your meeting at 10am!”).
Schedule daily push notification or in-app card.
Allow user to customize briefing content.
Considerations:
Localization for weather/news.
Respect user notification preferences.

3. Habit Tracker
Goal:
Enable users to set, track, and review daily habits/goals, with AI encouragement.
Key Tasks:
Design habit creation UI (e.g., “Drink water 3 times a day”).
Store habits and progress locally (and/or cloud sync).
Daily check-in reminders (push notifications).
Visualize progress (charts, streaks).
AI-generated encouragement and tips.
Optionally, integrate with Apple Health for fitness habits.
Considerations:
Data privacy for health-related habits.
Gamification (badges, streaks) for engagement.

4. Photo-to-Story
Goal:
Transform user photos into creative stories, social posts, or travel journals using AI.
Key Tasks:
Allow photo selection/upload.
Use AI (e.g., OpenAI Vision, Google ML Kit) to analyze photo content.
Generate creative text (story, caption, journal entry) based on photo and user prompt.
UI for editing and sharing generated stories.
Option to save stories in-app or export to social media.
Considerations:
User privacy for photo data.
Support for multiple photos (albums, travel logs).

5. Voice-to-Text Notes
Goal:
Let users record voice memos, transcribe them, and summarize with AI.
Key Tasks:
Integrate voice recording (Flutter plugin: speech_to_text, flutter_sound).
Transcribe audio to text (on-device or cloud).
Summarize note with AI (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).
UI for recording, playback, editing, and saving notes.
Search and organize notes.
Considerations:
On-device transcription for privacy.
Support for multiple languages.

6. Smart Summarizer
Goal:
Summarize long articles, PDFs, or web pages for easy reading.
Key Tasks:
Allow user to input text, upload PDF, or paste a URL.
Extract content from PDFs/web pages (use pdf_text, html).
Send content to AI summarizer (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).
Display concise summary with key points.
Option to save/share summaries.
Considerations:
File size and API limits.
Caching summaries for offline access.
